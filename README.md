Computer Science Midterm Program


The goal was to write a vocabulary program that lets you manipulate a text file to store words, and to create two games. One game is a definition-term matching game, and the other, an unscramble the word game.

To run this program, make sure you're on Python 3 and enter into your shell "python runme.py".
